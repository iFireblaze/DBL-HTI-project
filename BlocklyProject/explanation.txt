Drop all your files in the ardublockly folder as you would in the folder that you work in.
For example, if you add images that are contained in the img folder in the ardublockly folder than also put in the same folder here
Or if you made a new HTML page, put that page in the ardublockly folder here.
When you want to work on the latest version, download the ardublockly folder and update the old folder on your computer with the new one you just downloaded
This way you don't have to download the entire project, just the part that changes.
